# GmapApiTester

Simple e2e automation test written with selenium java.
Reads place name data from sql server, searches the lat and lng using the google places api and uses selenium framework to search the coordinates on goole maps and take a screen shot.
Currently will not work beacuse the sql is not avaliable.
